# ghx-bench-fixtures

Sandbox repository for `ghx` benchmark scenario fixtures.

This repository is intentionally used for synthetic benchmark artifacts:
- fixture issues and comments
- fixture pull requests and review threads
- fixture workflow runs
- fixture releases

Artifacts should be labeled with `bench-fixture` and `bench-seed:<id>` so they can be cleaned up safely.
